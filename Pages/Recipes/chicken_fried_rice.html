<h3>Instructions</h3>
<!--  -->
<ol>
<li>Prep all ingredients before starting the stove. Trim off excess fat and cut chicken thighs into bite-size pieces.<br>
 Transfer to a bowl and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. In a separate bowl, beat together 4 eggs.</li>
<li>Bring a large non-stick skillet or wok over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes,<br>
 stirring occasionally, or until fully cooked through. Transfer to a plate. </li>
<li>Reduce heat to medium. Add 1 Tbsp oil then scrambled eggs and stir and scramble for a minute, breaking up the egg with your spatula.<br>
 Cook just until no longer wet and immediately transfer to the plate with chicken.</li> 
<li>Use tongs to wipe skillet clean with a paper towel. Swirl in another 1 Tbsp oil then spread 5 cups rice evenly over the pan.<br>
 Cook 1 to 2 minutes without disturbing then stir and sauté another 1 to 2 minutes. Rice should sizzle.</li>
<li>Drizzle 2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil over the rice and stir well. Add fully thawed vegetables and mix well.</li>
<li>Add cooked chicken and scrambled eggs back to the pan. Add 1/4 cup green onion and mix well. Continue to cook until veggies and rice are <br>
 hot and rice sizzles, stirring frequently. Add more soy sauce and sesame oil to taste.</li>
